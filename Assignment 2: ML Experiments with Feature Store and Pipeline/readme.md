Project Assignment: 


This project is to design Feature Store with a ML Pipeline. <br>

Use athletes.csv <br>
Setup a ML pipeline in any MLOps platform of your choice.<br>
Use a feature store with the ML Pipeline.<br>
Load your data and create features with different version.<br>
Run experiments with the ML pipeline and feature store<br>
Create 2 different versions of features<br>
Train an algorithm with the 2 feature versions (do not use AutoML to select the algorithms)<br>
Train same algorithm with 2 different set of hyperparameters and 2 feature versions (so 4 combinations)<br>
Compare the results of the different experiments both quantitatively (model metrics) and qualitatively (model plots).<br>
Compare the carbon emissions for the different experiments.<br>
Submit working code for the above in your Github with apt video or screenshots depending on the MLOps platform you have choosen<br>
