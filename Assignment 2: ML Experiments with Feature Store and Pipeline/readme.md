Project Assignment: 


This project is to design Feature Store with a ML Pipeline.

Use athletes.csv
Setup a ML pipeline in any MLOps platform of your choice.
Use a feature store with the ML Pipeline.
Load your data and create features with different version.
Run experiments with the ML pipeline and feature store
Create 2 different versions of features
Train an algorithm with the 2 feature versions (do not use AutoML to select the algorithms)
Train same algorithm with 2 different set of hyperparameters and 2 feature versions (so 4 combinations)
Compare the results of the different experiments both quantitatively (model metrics) and qualitatively (model plots).
Compare the carbon emissions for the different experiments.
Submit working code for the above in your Github with apt video or screenshots depending on the MLOps platform you have choosen
