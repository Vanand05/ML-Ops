# Athlete Performance Prediction - Feature Store ML Pipeline

A complete MLOps pipeline using Feast Feature Store to predict high-performing athletes based on CrossFit competition data.

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning pipeline with feature store capabilities to predict athlete performance classification. The system uses two different feature versions, multiple algorithms, and tracks carbon emissions for sustainable ML operations.

### Assignment Requirements Met 
- Feature Store implementation with ML Pipeline (Feast)
- 2 different feature versions created and deployed
- 4 model combinations: 2 algorithms × 2 hyperparameter sets
- Quantitative and qualitative model comparison
- Carbon emissions tracking for all experiments

## Dataset

**Source:** Athletes.csv (423,006 records, 27 features)
**Target:** Binary classification - High Performer vs Regular Performer
**Criteria:** Athletes with Deadlift ≥350lbs, Snatch ≥150lbs, Pullups ≥20 reps
